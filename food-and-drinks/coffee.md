## Aeropress technique for espresso-style coffee \[from James Hoffman\]

## Inputs:

* 18g \(preferably\) espresso-roast coffee, on the finest Wilfa grind setting,
* \(?C\) 90g hot water.

## Method:

1. Pre-heat aeropress, rinse filter,
2. Inverted aeropress - plunger to middle of number 3,
3. Add coffee and water,
4. Stir well to break clumps,
5. Steep for 90 seconds,
6. Invert, swirl to make sure there are no grounds on the sides,
7. Give it a second for grounds to settle at the bottom,
8. Press VERY GENTLY and all the way.

## Output:

65-70 grams of strong coffee, ready for lattes/cappuccinos etc.

## Note:

Dairy and non-dairy milks irreparably break around 70C \(bad taste, low foam\). Prefer "barista-style" non-dairy options.

## Pour Over technique \[from James Hoffman\]

## Inputs:

* Brew ratio: 60 g/L \(e.g. 30 g per 500 mL\),
* Grind size: medium fine, progress to finer and dial back when too harsh and bitter,
* Temperature: the hotter, the better \(especially with lighter roasts\).

## Method:

1. Rinse filter with water just off the boil.
2. Add coffee grounds and create a well in the middle. This will evenly saturate all the grounds during blooming.
3. Start timer and add 2x \(up to 3x\) coffee weight of bloom water.
4. Swirl the coffee slurry until evenly mixed.
5. Bloom for up to 45s. This allows CO2 to escape which will improve extraction.
6. Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight in the next 30s.
7. Slowly add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight in the next 30s.
8. Stir 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon to knock off grounds from the side walls.
9. Allow water to drain a little and give it a gentle swirl to flatten the coffee bed bottom.
10. Aim to finish drawdawn by 3:30.
