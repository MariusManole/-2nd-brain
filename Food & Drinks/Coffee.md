# Coffee

## Aeropress technique for espresso-style coffee [from James Hoffman]
## Inputs:
* 18g (preferably) espresso-roast coffee, on the finest Wilfa grind setting,
* (?C) 90g hot water.

## Method:
1. Pre-heat aeropress, rinse filter,
1. Inverted aeropress - plunger to middle of number 3,
1. Add coffee and water,
1. Stir well to break clumps,
1. Steep for 90 seconds,
1. Invert, swirl to make sure there are no grounds on the sides,
1. Give it a second for grounds to settle at the bottom,
1. Press VERY GENTLY and all the way.

## Output:
65-70 grams of strong coffee, ready for lattes/cappucinos etc.

## Note: 
Dairy and non-dairy milks irreparably break around 70C (bad taste, low foam).
Prefer "barista-style" non-dairy options.
